">" - moves the data pointer right to the tape by one.
"<" - moves the data pointer left to the tape by one.
"0" - prints the current cell of the tape.
"%" - prints the ascii value associated with the cell on the tape.
"_" - prints both the current cell and the current loop value.
"|" - bitwise OR.
"+" - increases the loop counter by 1.
"-" - decreases the loop counter by 1.
"1" - prints the current loop value.
"^" - bitwise AND.
"!" - resets the tape cell to 0.
"$" - resets the loop counter to 0.
"#" - makes the loop value equal to the cell tape.
"?" - makes the cell tape equal to the loop value.
"&" - adds the loop value to the cell tape.
"*" - adds the cell tape to the loop value.
"," - bitwise XOR.
";" - ignores every character after it.
"a" - sets the cell tape to 65.
"/" - ignores every character after it.
"." - sets the cell tape to 32.
"~" - prints a newline.
"=" - waits 1 second.
"{" - starts a loop.
"}" - decreases the looper.
"x" - increases looper by 1.
"y" - decreases looper by 1.
":" - if/else seperator.
"(" - starts an if block.
")" - ends an if block.

+--- SEMANTICS ---+
- cell tape refers to the internal value of sixteenbit
- the loop counter refers to the internal value of cell
- the looper refers to the internal value of loop
- x and y increase and decrease the looper. this comes with the side effect of breaking the interpreter if you're not careful.
- currently, nested ifs execute everything inside the if block, including nested else blocks, while else blocks execute all else block, even ones nested in if blocks. i have no idea whether to call this a bug or a feature.
- if blocks only activate when cell is more than 0, and cell resets upon resolution.
- loops only execute more than once if cell was made to be >0 pre-loop.
