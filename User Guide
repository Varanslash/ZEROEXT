">" - moves the data pointer right to the tape by one.
"<" - moves the data pointer left to the tape by one.
"0" - prints the current cell of the tape.
"%" - prints the ascii value associated with the cell on the tape.
"_" - prints both the current cell and the current loop value.
"|" - bitwise OR.
"+" - increases the loop counter by 1.
"-" - decreases the loop counter by 1.
"1" - prints the current loop value.
"^" - bitwise AND.
"!" - resets the tape cell to 0.
"$" - resets the loop counter to 0.
"#" - makes the loop value equal to the cell tape.
"?" - makes the cell tape equal to the loop value.
"&" - adds the loop value to the cell tape.
"*" - adds the cell tape to the loop value.
"," - bitwise XOR.
";" - ignores every character after it.
"a" - sets the cell tape to 65.
"/" - ignores every character after it.
"." - sets the cell tape to 32.
"~" - prints a newline.
"=" - waits 1 second.
"{" - starts a loop.
"}" - decreases the looper.
"x" - increases looper by 1.
"y" - decreases looper by 1

+--- SEMANTICS ---+
- cell tape refers to the internal value of sixteenbit
- the loop counter refers to the internal value of cell
- the looper refers to the internal value of loop
- x and y increase and decrease the looper. this comes with the side effect of breaking the interpreter if you're not careful.
- currently, not more than one if/else is possible on any single line.

+--- CHANGELOG: ---+
V 1.2:
- nested loops have support now
- javascript was removed

V 1.3:

- [] are for notes now [they go in the brackets like this]
- ; no longer exists
- javascript was removed

V 1.4:

- if/else (:) have been added, seperated by :.
- bitwise operations officially do something now
- javascript was removed
