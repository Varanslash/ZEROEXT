+--- SEMANTICS ---+
- sixteenbit, cell, and loop are all internal values. as in, they are named that in the code.
- bitwise operations work as such: sixteenbit |= cell
- x and y increase and decrease the looper. this comes with the side effect of breaking the interpreter if you're not careful.
- currently, nested ifs execute everything inside the if block, including nested else blocks, while else blocks execute all else block, even ones nested in if blocks. i have no idea whether to call this a bug or a feature.
- if blocks only activate when cell is more than 0, and cell resets upon resolution.
- loops only execute more than once if cell was made to be >0 pre-loop.

+--- SYNTAX ---+
">" - moves the data pointer right to the sixteenbit register by one.
"<" - moves the data pointer left to the sixteenbit by one.
"0" - prints the current value of the sixteenbit register.
"%" - prints the ascii value associated with the value on sixteenbit.
"_" - prints both the current sixteenbit value and the current cell register value.
"|" - bitwise OR.
"+" - increases the cell by 1.
"-" - decreases the cell by 1.
"1" - prints the current cell register value.
"^" - bitwise AND.
"!" - resets the sixteenbit register to 0.
"$" - resets the cell register to 0.
"#" - makes the cell register equal to the sixteenbit register.
"?" - makes the sixteenbit register equal to the cell value.
"&" - adds the cell to the sixteenbit.
"*" - adds the sixteenbit to the cell.
"," - bitwise XOR.
"a" - sets the sixteenbit to 65.
"/" - a force stop.
"." - sets the sixteenbit register to 32.
"~" - prints a newline.
"=" - waits 1 second.
"{" - starts a loop.
"}" - decreases the loop register.
"x" - increases loop register by 1.
"y" - decreases loop register by 1.
":" - if/else seperator.
"(" - starts an if block.
")" - ends an if block.
"[" - starts note block.
"]" - ends note block.
